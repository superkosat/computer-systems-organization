# Computer Systems Organization : Recitation 03

## Bitwise Operations

In this set of exercises you will get some experience using the bitwise
operators in C.

### Exercises

* Fill in the TODO's starting at part01.c and working your way up to part11.c
* Submit your solution to NYU Classes as a single zip file.

#### Tip

To quickly compile and test your code (to see if the tests pass)
use a command like the following...  

```
gcc util.c partX.c
./a.out
```

.. where X is the part number.

When you think you have all the tests passing you can run the `test-all.sh` script.

```
./test-all.sh
```
