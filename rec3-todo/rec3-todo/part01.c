/*
The most basic bitwise operators are the left and right shift bitwise operators.
These operators work by shifting the bits over by a designated number
'b' of slots. Lets take a look at how these shifts work.

The block below shows how these operators work on the bit level.
Note that in the diagram the shifts or 'b',  is usually written
as a decimal integer.

Left Bit Shift <<
00000001 << 2 = 00000100 (1 << 2 = 4)
00000101 << 3 = 00101000 (5 << 3 = 40)

Right Bit Shift >>
000010100 >> 3 = 00000010 (20 >> 3 = 2)
000000010 >> 2 = 00000000 (2 >> 2 = 0)

Note that shifting more than the size of the type is undefined behavior.

In the examples below, we use char as a type to be able to
use only 8 bits.
